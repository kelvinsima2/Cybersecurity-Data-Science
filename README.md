# Cybersecurity-Data-Science

- The main aim of this project is to conduct a comparison study of different machine learning algorithms used to detect cyber attacks using several datasets and evaluation metrics. In this project, the CICIDS2017, CICDDoS2019 and the NSL-KDD datasets were investigated.
- One of the main challenges facing anomaly detection is the high rate of false alarms. The best ML algorithm for detecting cyber attacks was therefore investigated.
- Decision Tree classifier performed the best in terms of both accuracy and speed in detecting cyber attacks within a multi-class context using the CICIDS2017 and CICDDoS2019 datasets. Using the CICIDS2017 dataset, the Decision Tree classifier had an accuracy score of 99% and an average training time of 0.029s. Using the CICDDoS2019 dataset, the Decision Tree classifier had an accuracy score of 95% and an average training time of 0.025s. 
- The Naive Bayes classifier performed the best in detecting attacks in a binary context using the NSL-KDD Dataset. An accuracy score of 80% and an average training time of 0.043s was achieved.
